=Python Twitter=

_A Python wrapper around the Twitter API_

Author: `The Python-Twitter Developers <python-twitter@googlegroups.com>`

==Introduction==

This library provides a pure Python interface for the Twitter API.

Twitter (http://twitter.com) provides a service that allows people to
connect via the web, IM, and SMS.  Twitter exposes a web services API
(http://dev.twitter.com/doc) and this library is intended to make
it even easier for Python programmers to use.

==Building==

*From source:*

Install the dependencies:

  http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson
  http://github.com/brosner/python-oauth2
  http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/

Download the latest python-twitter library from:

  http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

Extract the source distribution and run:

{{{
  $ python setup.py build
  $ python setup.py install
}}}

*Testing*

With setuptools installed:

{{{
  $ python setup.py test
}}}

Without setuptools installed:

{{{
  $ python twitter_test.py
}}}

==Using==

The library provides a Python wrapper around the Twitter API and
the Twitter data model.

*Model:*

The three model classes are twitter.Status, twitter.User, and
twitter.DirectMessage.  The API methods return instances of these
classes.

To read the full API for twitter.Status, twitter.User, or
twitter.DirectMessage, run:

{{{
  $ pydoc twitter.Status
  $ pydoc twitter.User
  $ pydoc twitter.DirectMessage
}}}

*API:*

The API is exposed via the twitter.Api class.

To create an instance of the twitter.Api class:

{{{
  >>> import twitter
  >>> api = twitter.Api()
}}}

To create an instance of the twitter.Api with login credentials (many API
calls required the client to be authenticated.)

The python-twitter library now only supports oAuth authentication as the
Twitter devs have indicated that oAuth is the only method that will be
supported moving forward.

The username parameter to twitter.Api() is named that because some calls
still allow for un-authenticated access, and for them you can pass in a
screen name or twitter ID.  This will probably change (again) soon.


  >>> api = twitter.Api(username='consumer_key', password='consumer_secret',
                        access_token_key='access_token',
                        access_token_secret='access_token_secret')


To fetch the most recently posted public Twitter status messages:

{{{
  >>> statuses = api.GetPublicTimeline()
  >>> print [s.user.name for s in statuses]
  [u'DeWitt', u'Kesuke Miyagi', u'ev', u'Buzz Andersen', u'Biz Stone'] 
}}}

To fetch a single user's public status messages, where "user" is either
a Twitter "short name" or their user id.

{{{
  >>> statuses = api.GetUserTimeline(user)
  >>> print [s.text for s in statuses]
}}}

To fetch a list a user's friends (requires authentication):

{{{
  >>> users = api.GetFriends()
  >>> print [u.name for u in users]
}}}

To post a Twitter status message (requires authentication):

{{{
  >>> status = api.PostUpdate('I love python-twitter!')
  >>> print status.text
  I love python-twitter!
}}}

There are many more API methods, to read the full API documentation:

{{{
  $ pydoc twitter.Api
}}}

==Todo==

Patches and bug reports are welcome, just please keep the style
consistent with the original source.

Add more example scripts.

The twitter.Status and twitter.User classes are going to be hard
to keep in sync with the API if the API changes.  More of the
code could probably be written with introspection.

Statement coverage of twitter_test is only about 80% of twitter.py.

The twitter.Status and twitter.User classes could perform more
validation on the property setters.
